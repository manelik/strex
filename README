README FILE FOR STWIT
changing name to strex

A COMMAND LINE TWITTER CLIENT

As ssh stands for "secure shell", strex was meant to be stwit so it
could stand for secure twit, but since the name was already taken it
was the same history as twirex and it became strex. Whatever this is a
console based twitter client that won't reveal so easily that you're
tweeting at work hours.


REQUERIMENTS

oauth2 lib
