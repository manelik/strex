README FILE FOR STREX

A COMMAND LINE TWITTER CLIENT


As ssh stands for "secure shell", strex was meant to be stwit so it
could stand for secure twit, but since the name was already taken it
was the same history as twirex and it became strex. Whatever this is a
console based twitter client that won't reveal so easily that you're
tweeting at work hours.

Already mentioned how the name came to be, but it actually can be
meant as an acronym for

Secure Twitter Remote Engine X
the X is for added coolpoints


REQUERIMENTS

python
oauth2 lib
oauth-twitter-python2 lib maybe a little hacking on this one

oauthtwitter.py(82) must read

80        if http_method == "POST":
81            encoded_post_data = req.to_postdata()
82            url = req.normalized_url
83        else:
84            url = req.to_url()
85            encoded_post_data = ""
            
or else it should fail when posting


INSTALLATION/PREPARATION

There's not really something as installation, you just run strex.py
but it's necesary to have the config folder and maybe empty config
files.

you@urmachine:~$ mkdir .strex
you@urmachine:~$ touch consumer.info
you@urmachine:~$ touch login.info
you@urmachine:~$ touch ulog

For the consumer key/secret you need to gain my trust or else register
your own app at
 
http://twitter.com/oauth_clients

write them in consumer.info as
consumerkey&value
consumersecret&value

And you are done!
strex ready for your command line twitting
